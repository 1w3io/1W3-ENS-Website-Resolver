## Introduction
"1W3 - ENS Website Resolver" is a Chrome extension designed to be your portal to the decentralised web (dWeb). It enables effortless resolution of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) `.eth` domains, providing users with seamless access to decentralised content.

## Features
- **ENS Domain Resolution**: Instantly resolves .eth domains into readable IPFS links or content hashes, facilitating direct access to decentralised sites and content.
- **Custom Gateway Option**: Allows users to specify a custom IPFS gateway for resolving `.eth` domains.
- **Informative Redirects**: In cases where a .eth domain cannot be resolved (e.g., due to missing hash in the records), users are redirected to eth.lk. eth.lk dynamically fetches and displays additional ENS records and details for the queried domain from ensrecords.xyz, enhancing user understanding and engagement with the ENS ecosystem.
- **Privacy-Conscious**: No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted.
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requires only essential permissions for operation.
